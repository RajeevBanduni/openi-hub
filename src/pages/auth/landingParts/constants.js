/**
 * Landing page constants — Phase 167 (W5-4).

 * VERBATIM slices of the pre-split src/pages/auth/Landing.jsx:
 *   16-22  ICON_MAP        (CMS icon-name string -> lucide component)
 *   24-33  brand colours   (Option B Light tokens)
 *   52-96  DEFAULT_*       (fallbacks if /api/public/landing-content fails)
 *
 * The 28 lucide names below are exactly ICON_MAP's keys — nothing else in
 * this file references a component.

// Backend normally returns live DB-counted stats which override these defaults.
// Match backend labels so visual layout doesn't shift on hydration.
// Labels are written for the visitor, not for our data model (UX audit,
// 21 Aug 2026). "Personas" is the internal name for the role a user signs up
// as; a corporate innovation lead does not think of themselves as picking a
// persona, and a stat tile is the worst place to teach someone a taxonomy.
// "AI Clusters" stated a mechanism where a benefit belongs — the number only
// means something once you know it is what makes search return peers rather
// than keyword matches. The `Global Startups` label must stay exactly as-is:
// Landing.jsx overlays the live DB count by matching on that string.
const DEFAULT_STATS = [
  { value: '575K+', label: 'Global Startups' },
  // '240+' is a floor claim on purpose: the curated taxonomy grows (241 at
  // s113) and a hardcoded exact count drifts stale — the hero-number
  // incident above is the precedent. Raise the floor only in big jumps.

const DEFAULT_FAQS = [
  { q: 'Who can join OpenI?', a: 'Anyone in the innovation ecosystem \u2014 startups, corporates, investors, government bodies, mentors, labs, incubators, accelerators, service providers, students, and academia. All 11 persona types get a tailored dashboard, directory listing, and workflow tools.' },
  { q: 'Is OpenI free to use?', a: 'Yes! The Free tier gives you access to the core platform including keyword search, directory, meetings, messaging, and up to 1 challenge per month. Paid plans are listed exclusive of GST (18% added at checkout, per Indian Tax). Upgrade to Pro for AI Semantic Search, richer limits, and advanced workflows. Enterprise unlocks unlimited everything plus dedicated support.' },
  { q: 'What is AI Ask \u2014 and how is it different from keyword search?', a: 'AI Ask lets you type natural-language queries like \u201cearly-stage deeptech healthcare startups in Bangalore that raised Seed\u201d and our query-parser model translates that into structured filters (sector + stage + city + deeptech flag) then runs it against our FTS + vector search stack. Results come back ranked, with the AI\u2019s interpretation shown above the list so you can verify what it understood. Pro tier and above.' },
  { q: 'What is the 8-Vector Evaluation Framework?', a: 'A proprietary scoring system that evaluates startups across 8 dimensions: Market, Team, Tech, Traction, Financials, IP, Scalability, and Strategic Fit. Investors use it in their deal pipeline; incubators and accelerators run it as time-series checkpoints (Entry \u2192 Mid-program \u2192 Demo Day \u2192 Graduation) to track portfolio progress on a radar chart.' },
  { q: 'Can incubators and accelerators track their portfolio health?', a: 'Yes. The Portfolio Health tab inside each Program or Batch shows an 8-vector radar of your portfolio average, flags at-risk startups (overall score < 3 or red flags set), and tracks each startup\u2019s progression across multiple checkpoints \u2014 so you can intervene early and measure the impact of your mentorship.' },
  { q: 'How does the Challenge Marketplace work?', a: 'Corporates, investors, and government bodies post open innovation challenges with sector tags, budget ranges, data rooms, and FAQs. Startups apply with structured proposals; seekers evaluate, rate (1-5 stars), and move applicants through a drag-and-drop pipeline into active collaborations with milestones, tasks, and budget tracking.' },
  { q: 'Does OpenI support multi-currency for global programs?', a: 'Yes. All monetary fields (funding, investment, ticket sizes, perks, etc.) support both INR and USD natively, with compact locale-appropriate display (\u20B95L, \u20B92Cr, $60K, $1.5M). Users can set their preferred currency in Settings \u2192 Profile. No FX conversion \u2014 each amount keeps its entered currency for honest reporting.' },
  { q: 'I am an investor AND a mentor — do I need two accounts?', a: 'No. One account holds multiple roles. Sign up with your primary role, then add as many additional roles as you need from your dashboard. Each role gets its own dashboard, sidebar, and workflows; switch between them with one click using the role tabs at the top of any dashboard page. One inbox, one watchlist, separate per-role billing if you upgrade to Pro on a specific role.' },
